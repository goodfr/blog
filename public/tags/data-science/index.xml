      <description>Disclaimer : I am a huge fan of the R language thus this post is biased toward the few things I know about Python and SAS linguas.

Indeed knowing better a language shapes also your thinking so you can organize yourself better with the task at hand and not feel too overwhelmed (like during your internship).</description>
