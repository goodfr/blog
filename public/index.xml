Side note : such imputation method should not work well, but this an other questionâ€¦
Once reformulated this problem can be rephrased into 2 problems :
How to produce a number randomly from a sample {X} within the range [mean(X) - sd(X) , mean(X) + sd(X)]How to apply a transformation over the numeric variables of a data frame</description>
